We create a website for Smart city development. It will be a complaint form type where users can directly post the local problems (like road damage, water shortage, frequent electricity outage, etc) with supporting pictures and after affirming the same issue by at least a significant number of people of the same residence (say 20). The site will be made public to all users so that everyone can access the progress made by the concerned authorities to mitigate the problem. It will also help to reduce the time taken to resolve the issues. 

While submitting the issue to the site, the user will also add preset labels to concerns such as road damage and stray animals, to mention a few, which will help categorize the problems effectively.

The site will also have an upvote and downvote system, allowing more severe concerning issues to be addressed first and avoiding spam requests.
